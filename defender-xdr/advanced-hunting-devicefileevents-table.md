# DeviceFileEvents table in the advanced hunting schema - Microsoft Defender XDR | Microsoft Learn

The `DeviceFileEvents` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview) schema contains information about file creation, modification, and other file system events. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

Tip

For detailed information about the events types (`ActionType` values) supported by a table, use the built-in schema reference available in the Defender portal.

This advanced hunting table is populated by records from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. If your organization hasn't deployed the service in Microsoft Defender, queries that use the table aren't going to work or return any results. For more information about how to deploy Defender for Endpoint in the Defender portal, read [Deploy supported services](deploy-supported-services).

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, [see the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables).

| `InitiatingProcessAccountDomain` | `string` | Domain of the account that ran the process responsible for the event |
| `InitiatingProcessAccountName` | `string` | User name of the account that ran the process responsible for the event; if the device is registered in Microsoft Entra ID, the Entra ID user name of the account that ran the process responsible for the event might be shown instead |
| `InitiatingProcessAccountSid` | `string` | Security Identifier (SID) of the account that ran the process responsible for the event |
| `InitiatingProcessAccountUpn` | `string` | User principal name (UPN) of the account that ran the process responsible for the event; if the device is registered in Microsoft Entra ID, the Entra ID UPN of the account that ran the process responsible for the event might be shown instead |
| `InitiatingProcessAccountObjectId` | `string` | Microsoft Entra object ID of the user account that ran the process responsible for the event |
| `InitiatingProcessMD5` | `string` | MD5 hash of the process (image file) that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessSHA1` | `string` | SHA-1 of the process (image file) that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessSHA256` | `string` | SHA-256 of the process (image file) that initiated the event. This field is usually not populated — use the SHA1 column when available. |
| `InitiatingProcessFolderPath` | `string` | Folder containing the process (image file) that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessFileName` | `string` | Name of the process file that initiated the event; if unavailable, the name of the process that initiated the event might be shown instead |
| `InitiatingProcessFileSize` | `long` | Size of the process (image file) that initiated the event |
| `InitiatingProcessVersionInfoCompanyName` | `string` | Company name from the version information of the process (image file) responsible for the event |

| `InitiatingProcessCreationTime` | `datetime` | Date and time when the process that initiated the event was started |
| `InitiatingProcessIntegrityLevel` | `string` | Integrity level of the process that initiated the event. Windows assigns integrity levels to processes based on certain characteristics, such as if they were launched from an internet download. These integrity levels influence permissions to resources. |

Note

File hash information will always be shown when it is available. However, there are several possible reasons why a SHA1, SHA256, or MD5 cannot be calculated. For instance, the file might be located in remote storage, locked by another process, compressed, or marked as virtual. In these scenarios, the file hash information appears empty.
